#Card Creation Tool
#This project is a tool to help facilitate card generation for a card game
#The user should provide a CSV file with the correct headers so that the python program can use each data entry to generate cards
#Headers are General Name,Specific Card Name,Tags,Rules Text,Card Type,Card Functionality Type,Mana Cost,Flavor Text
#The program will then draw the data taken from the CSV onto a provided image and save the image in its specified path
#The Program will avoid duplicate card image names by enumerating the name where conflicts arise
#
#
#
#Built in Python and utilizing Pillow
#This is a work in progress
